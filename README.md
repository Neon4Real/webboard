# Discord Bot Template

ðŸš§ This project is currently in active development

## Features

-   [x] Node.js Discord Bot with discord-fp
-   [x] Kafka Event Streaming
-   [x] Dashboard using Next.js App Router
-   [ ] Documentation Website (Work in progress)

## Scalability

### Don't depend on "Server"

We use Kafka for handling real operations via dashboard, so that no requests will be sent to the server that hosts the discord bot directly.

This brings a faster load speed and more better stability because the dashboad will still works even if the discord bot is temporarily unavailable.

### Serverless Ready

The dashboard is built for serverless, you are able to deploy it to any serverless hosting platforms such as Vercel, Azure and AWS.

Notice that the Discord bot server can only be deployed to traditional Node.js Server hosting services, serverless environment is incompatible.
